Simple util to calicalte differance between two dates without the use of exsting java libaries.

At the moment it calculates the days since a set EPOC date. Currently set to the year 2000.
This is done in this way since it calculates days since the epoc using loops, and limiting the start date reduses the number of loops.

Not a very optimal way to calculating it.
